        <h1>Introduction</h1>
      </header>
        <p> A computer is a machine that can be instructed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations automatically via computer programming. Modern computers have the ability to follow generalized sets of operations, called programs. These programs enable computers to perform an extremely wide range of tasks. A "complete" computer including the hardware, the operating system (main software), and peripheral equipment required and used for "full" operation can be referred to as a computer system. This term may as well be used for a group of computers that are connected and work together, in particular a computer network or computer cluster. </p>       
        <h2> Computer's main components: </h2>
        <p> The term hardware covers all of those parts of a computer that are tangible physical objects. Circuits, computer chips, graphic cards, sound cards, memory (RAM), motherboard, displays, power supplies, cables, keyboards, printers and "mice" input devices are all hardware. </p>

        <h1>Processor</h1>        
      </header>
      <p> A central processing unit <code>CPU</code>, also called a central processor or main processor, is the electronic circuitry within a computer that executes instructions that make up a computer program. The CPU performs basic arithmetic, logic, controlling, and input/output (I/O) operations specified by the instructions in the program. </p>
      <p> Cloud computing can involve subdividing CPU operation into virtual central processing units. </p>
      <p> A host is the virtual equivalent of a physical machine, on which a virtual system is operating. When there are several physical machines operating in tandem and managed as a whole, the grouped computing and memory resources form a cluster. In some systems, it is possible to dynamically add and remove from a cluster. Resources available at a host and cluster level can be partitioned out into resources pools with fine granularity.</p>

        <h1>Motherboard</h1>           
      </header>
      <p> A <code>motherboard</code> (alternatively known as the mainboard, main circuit board, system board, baseboard, planar board or logic board, or colloquially, a mobo) is the main printed circuit board (PCB) found in general purpose computers and other expandable systems. It holds, and allows communication between, many of the crucial electronic components of a system, such as the central processing unit (CPU) and memory, and provides connectors for other peripherals.  </p>
      <p> Motherboards contain some non-volatile memory to initialize the system and load some startup software, usually an operating system, from some external peripheral device. </p>

         <h1>Video Card</h1>
      </header>   
      <p>  A <code>video card</code> (also called a display card, graphics card, display adapter, or graphics adapter) is an expansion card which generates a feed of output images to a display device (such as a computer monitor). Frequently, these are advertised as discrete or dedicated graphics cards, emphasizing the distinction between these and integrated graphics. </p>
        <p> As of 2016, the primary suppliers of the GPUs (video chips or chipsets) used in video cards are <code>AMD and Nvidia</code>.</p>
        <p>Beyond the gaming and multimedia segments, video cards have been increasingly used for general-purpose computing, such as big data processing. The growth of cryptocurrency has placed a severely high demand on high-end video cards, especially in large quantities, due to their advantages in the process of mining. In January 2018, mid-to-high-end video cards experienced a major surge in price, with many retailers having stock shortages due to the significant demand among this market. Video card companies released mining-specific cards designed to run 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and without video output ports. </p>

        <h1>RAM Memory</h1>             
      </header>
      <p> Random-access memory <code>RAM</code> is a form of computer memory that can be read and changed in any order, typically used to store working data and machine code. A random-access memory device allows data items to be read or written in almost the same amount of time irrespective of the physical location of data inside the memory. In contrast, with other direct-access data storage media such as hard disks, CD-RWs, DVD-RWs and the older magnetic tapes and drum memory, the time required to read and write data items varies significantly depending on their physical locations on the recording medium, due to mechanical limitations such as media rotation speeds and arm movement. </p>
